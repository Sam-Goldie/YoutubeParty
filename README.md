# YoutubeSoir√©e

Youtube Soiree is an in-development single-page app that allows multiple users to watch Youtube videos with syncronized playback in what is commonly known as a "watch party."

Features include: 
* Syncronized playback (obviously)
* A text chat feature
* A field to submit youtube video links to change what's playing

Priority changes to come:
* Deployment + the ability to host more than one watch party similtaneously
* An optional full-screen + chat mode that will facilitate communication without disrupting the show

Future features:
* Implementing in-app youtube search for greater convenience
* Envision and then implement a more appealing styling for the app

# Installation

Fork or clone this repo down. Once on your local environment, I recommend installing dependencies with "npm install"

To start the nodemon server: npm run dev

Default port for the app is 3000.

# Technologies

* YoutubeSoiree is written in Javascript. 
* Static files are served up by Express, and video sync and text chat are both handled through Socket.io.
