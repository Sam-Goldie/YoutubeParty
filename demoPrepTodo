Features to implement:

Emojis
Modal that asks you to name yourself when you start
A queue for videos that can be set to autoplay
A custom full-screen with a togglable chat sidebar

Fixes to make:
Need to make sure that playback is always synced, regardless of user behavior (something wasn't quite right in that regard)

Stretch goals:
An account system with a signin and basic authentication
A basic profile where you could view your video history.
